# TAS
This is the spinlock for HW7 SOFT3410 2020 Semester2

## Testing
```bash
#define TEST_ITERATION (1000000)
#define N_THREADS (4)
```
On line 10 and 11 there is the number of iteration and threads.

The expected Values should be TEST_ITERATION * N_THREADS.

When you run the program it will print out the expected value and the obtained value. 

```bash 
EXPECTED VALUE = 400000000
OBTAINED VALUE = 400000000
```
